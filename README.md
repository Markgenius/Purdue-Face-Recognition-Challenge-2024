# Purdue-Face-Recognition-Challenge-2024
This challenge is to perform face recognition on a subset of Celebrity Face Dataset. You are asked to implement and train a machine-learning model to classify each image according to the face in it. There are 100 celebrity faces in total, so think of this challenge as a 100-class classification problem.
